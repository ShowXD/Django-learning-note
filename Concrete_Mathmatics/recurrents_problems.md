# Recurrents Problems

## Chapter 1
### The Tower of Hanoi
`Q: How many moves are necessary and sufficient to perform task?`  
$T_1 = 1, T_2 = 3$
$T_n = 2T_n-1 = 2(2^n-1) + 1 = 2^n - 1$

### Lines in the Plane
`Q: What is the max. no. L_n of region defined by n lines in the plane?`  
`(first solved in 1826, by the Swiss mathmatician Jacob Steiner)`  
$2^n - 1, n(n+1)/2, n!$
